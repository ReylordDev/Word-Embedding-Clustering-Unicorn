This is is an adaptation of word embedding clustering as suggested by [Nicolas et al. (2022)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/pspa0000312) for the [Unicorn lab](https://tmorgenr.wixsite.com/unicornlab) at Purdue University.

All detailed explanations are to be found in the `word_embedding_clustering.py` and `word_embedding_clustering_with_conditions.py`.

To see an example clustering, you can run `word_embedding_clustering.py` with the `test_input_file.csv` that is part of this code distribution.
